At Reema Health, we believe that a personalized, community-based approach to care makes it easier for anyone to access the things they need to make their lives better. We know that life's challenges often exist because the systems built to help are a burden to navigate. We believe building a relationship with a real person &mdash; someone who listens, meets our members where they are, and understands the community&mdash; can ease those burdens and effectively connect members to health care. Our mission-driven and member-focused company is seeking an experienced and self-motivated Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner to serve the behavioral healthcare needs of our members.
Reema is taking a value-based approach to care, so this role will work diligently to provide the right amount of care at the right time for each of our members.

The Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner is an integral part of our team, helping lead the creation and implementation of tech-enabled behavioral healthcare for our members. At Reema, we believe integrating social and clinical care is the most effective way to support member wellbeing and sustained clinical outcomes. You'll see members in an outpatient clinical setting via telehealth. You will be part of a multidisciplinary team made up of Psychotherapists and non-clinical Community Guides to collaboratively provide a holistic approach to member health and support you to work at the top of your license.

- Support post-discharge planning to prevent readmissions
- Provide medical evaluation of patients who are experiencing psychotic symptoms or may be at risk from alcoholism, drug abuse or addiction
- Use EMR to manage member care and coordination with multidisciplinary team
- Contribute to the evolving design and implementation of clinical pathways and protocols for treatment of behavioral health conditions in Reema's care model

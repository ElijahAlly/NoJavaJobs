On the fence? If you're interested in the job but worried you aren't qualified, we encourage you to err on the side of applying. We'd hate to miss out on great candidates just because they're worried they don't check every box on the job description.
We know it is a time commitment to prepare an application and we respect that effort by thoughtfully reviewing every complete application and responding one way or the other.

- Flexible work schedule and environment. Our employees are encouraged to work where they feel the safest and most productive. Our office in Lincoln Park in Chicago is open (and fully stocked with snacks) for folks that prefer to work in the office. Due to various legal and tax implications we can only offer employment to residents of the following states: California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin.
- Flexible PTO. Take time off when you need to recharge, take a trip, or just catch up on life.

Interested?
Great, we look forward to reading your application. Please include:
- Your resume.
- A cover letter. You don't need to be a professional writer for this job (we have those) but we would love to hear more about you that we can't see from your resume.
On the fence? If you're interested in the job but worried you aren't qualified, we encourage you to err on the side of applying. We'd hate to miss out on great candidates just because they're worried they don't check every box on the job description.
We know it is a time commitment to prepare an application and we respect that effort by thoughtfully reviewing every complete application and responding one way or the other. But that kind of thoughtful review means that it sometimes takes us a while to get back to applicants, so please be patient with us and no phone calls.

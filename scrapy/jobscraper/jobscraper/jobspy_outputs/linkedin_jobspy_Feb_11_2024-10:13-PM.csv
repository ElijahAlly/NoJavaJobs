SpiderOak is committed to building secure and reliable software that protects our customers’ data. Our approach is fundamentally different from most mainstream security companies. Instead of adding layers of security on top of an insecure system, we build software that is inherently secure.
SpiderOak builds need-to-know technology that supports customers working in hostile environments. Traditional systems trust IT infrastructure to maintain the whole security system, even though the news is rife with evidence that this model does not work. Our software combines end to end encryption with a distributed ledger (aka Blockchain) technology to offer best-in-class security with no backdoors.
Who We Need
- A curious, creative, Software Engineer with relevant work experience in an Agile/Scrum environment. You'll have a desire to continue to build your skills and knowledge in Cryptography, or you'll bring some experience with Cryptography to SpiderOak.

- You will thrive at SpiderOak if you have a sense of initiative and are a self-starter who enjoys working collaboratively across cross-functional teams, with the unique ability to work in a fully remote/virtual environment. 
What You'll Do
- Develop and/or maintain advanced knowledge of computing system integrations and make recommendations or decisions on software and hardware configurations and developments.
- Provide analysis and recommended design of applications, middleware, and system architecture to solve complex problems.
- Apply a structured approach to design and implementation of systems and processes.
- Translate mission and customer requirements into capabilities, testing, and validation of services.
- Analyze and allocates requirements to system architecture components and oversee the development, testing, and validation of systems and services.
- Coordinate the integration of systems and services and oversee deployments.
- Extend our current codebase to provide new capabilities and enhanced assurance and performance.
What To Expect
- In the first year in the role, you'll be learning to collaborate with multiple teams in order to understand our product, Orbitsecure. An ability to understand hardware configurations, and how to develop or alter solutions around multiple environments, will be key to your success. All this leads to our ultimate goal: Successfully deploying Orbitsecure in space.
- Some travel, up to 10%, may be required.
- SpiderOak Inc. and Mission Systems is a 100% remote-based working environment. Our culture is based on trust and flexibility. We believe our employees are the key to our success, and welcome new ideas and talents.

- Meritocracy, not politics: We place the utmost value on results and rewards through merit, not reward actions driven by political agendas or behavior.

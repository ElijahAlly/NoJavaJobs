Frontend Software Engineer
Software Engineering, Full-time, Remote
Synthesis is making a statement in education by building a superhuman tutor.
We’re looking for a frontend software engineer to join the Tutor content team. This is a critical-path team responsible for building the core of our product: our engaging, interactive, content. Specifically, you’ll be building “Widgets”, which are highly interactive parts of the Tutor lessons. Think digital math manipulatives. Building content is a deeply collaborative process between the content authors, developers and widget engineers. It requires a high degree of creativity, resourcefulness, patience and flexibility. You’ll dive deep into how we currently work and help us optimize it as you grow into your role. We’re just starting to ramp up the product, so joining us now means a LOT of influence on the future of the product. Given that, we expect a broad set of skills — both interpersonal skills and technical skills. For this role we’re looking for someone with several years of experience working in fast-paced, growth-mode environments creating interactive products and applications.
Check out an example
 lesson in the Synthesis Tutor here.
Why Is Building Synthesis Tutor Special
- We are building the world’s best Digital Tutor. We create deep, meaningful learning experiences that accelerate math learning for kids.
- We are a team of super-collaborators. Building the learning experiences is a highly collaborative process.
- We are a fast-moving team. We launch new concepts rapidly and iterate on the content after seeing it in action with our users.
- Witnessing our students’ attitude towards math transform within a few tutor sessions is an absolute joy.
Technical Skill Requirements
- At least 2 years of functional React experience (including custom hooks).
- Strong CSS skills, preferably including Tailwind and Framer Motion.
- Fluent with Typescript
- Fluent with Git
- Ability to design and build visually appealing and intuitive experiences.
Soft Skill Requirements
- This role requires a large amount of synchronous, creative brainstorming and iteration. Sometimes you’ll build a widget only to figure out once prototyped that it was the wrong approach. You’ll need to handle these situations with grace and maintain your motivation to start over with a new approach.
- Ideas at Synthesis are always open to criticism from anyone, in any role. We welcome this. The best ideas are born out of [sometimes harsh] conjecture and criticism. You’ll need to have thick skin.
- We’re pushing the boundaries in many areas. You’ll need to be resourceful.
- We have two customers: the children using the Tutor and their parents. Understanding the needs of both is critical to building a winning product.
If you are interested in this position and have a passion for learning and creating educational content, please apply with your resume and portfolio of previous work. We look forward to hearing from you!

- Excellent written communication skills & a design-minded consideration of abstractions. A big part of simplifying software development is choosing the right abstractions & communicating them effectively. In this role, you'll be responsible for designing and crafting internal and external systems and APIs that are elegant and intuitive to use.

Staff Software Engineer – Frontend
 to join International Digital Experiences team. Want to change how different countries shop online? Then keep reading!
About Team: 
Our team collaborates with Walmart International, which has over 5,900 retail units operating outside of the United States under 55 banners in 26 countries including Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, and Mexico, to name a few.
What you'll do:
Walmart International is a diverse and fast-growing business unit, so you'll get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you'll do:
- Research, guide, and execute frontend architecture changes, including but by no means limited to GraphQL, server-side React rendering, and Flow typing.
- Build reusable React components with modular CSS, manage data on the client with Redux, use react query, and GraphQL.
- Measure and resolve performance bottlenecks, using tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, WebPagetest, or custom tooling.
- Refactor or improve existing code. And we constantly find ways to improve all of our JavaScript code.
- Work closely with our product, design, and UX teams to create amazing and intuitive experiences that make it effortless to connect different apps together.
- Help put tools, processes, and documentation in place to improve our code quality.
- Review code written by other team members or other teams.
- Ship to hundreds of thousands of users every day while having lots of autonomy in terms of code and feature ownership.
- Work with complex and varied data structures (APIs can be a little, uh, eccentric).
- Help out with our Node-based developer platform.
- Share what you know and learn either one-on-one or with lightning talks to the group.
- Give back to the community via open source and blog posts.
- Experiment: this is a startup-like environment so everything can change as we experiment with doing more custom partnership work.
- As a part of Walmart’s all-hands philosophy, help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible.
- You'll also have the opportunity to specialize in a variety of areas of the codebase, including core product or platform development. Focusing on a specialization will not limit your area for growth at Walmart, as each engineer brings a unique perspective and can contribute differently to all areas. We encourage participation and will frequently have engineers contribute across teams to assist in projects. 
What you'll bring:
- You love code. You love to take raw ideas and build great products with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You know JavaScript is imperfect, but you embrace its functional side and genuinely enjoy coding with it. You might like to talk about obscure computer science topics, but really, you just want to write simple code and ship new products and features to customers (or improve existing ones).
- You love great UX. You spend most of your time coding, but you also have an eye for great design and a feel for great UX. Maybe you were once a designer (or still are) or maybe your creative outlet has always been the code. Either way, you care about more than just the code.
- You love learning new things. You love researching new tech and driving forward with the implementation details. Your focus is on frontend JavaScript code, but you can dig in wherever needed. Node.js, GraphQL, NextJS, Nx, build tools, shell scripts, you name it. If you don't already know it, you're ready to learn it.
- You can balance lots of concerns. Frontend apps have to take into account performance (using networks and devices that we can't control), customer demands, A/B tests, UX research, code quality, a rapidly changing ecosystem of languages and modules, and the list goes on. And we actually want to ship things too! You can balance those demands without getting overwhelmed and keep the needle moving forward.
- You love helping others. You love sharing knowledge with the rest of your team, building shared tooling for other engineers, giving back to the open-source community, and directly helping customers.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
About The Role
As a Core Product engineer, you will directly contribute to the foundational pieces of Notion's building blocks. You will be a key player in building a robust technical foundation that allows Notion to achieve the connected workspace vision. Your work will include both internal platform contributions to accelerate other Notion engineering teams, and end-user facing functionality to enable toolmaking ubiquity. The team acts as a multiplier for the engineering organization, has outsize impact on how fast Notion grows, and guides the full-stack direction. Moreover, you will be presented with challenging technical problems as Notion’s product needs are complex. You’ll also play a key role in identifying and executing against technical investments that ensure the long-term quality, reliability, and performance of databases in Notion as we scale. Lastly, you’ll be part of a new team! You will help define team norms, operating principles, team culture, and much more.
What You'll Achieve
- You’ll work with a team of engineers and cross-functional partners across product, design, data science, and user research to define a product strategy and drive execution through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance.
- You’ll build and maintain foundational pieces of Notion’s building blocks, enabling a wide array of use cases in Notion such as docs, wikis, issue tracking, project management, and more.
- You’ll contribute to the overall performance, reliability, and robustness of the Notion product, ensuring it scales elegantly across many dimensions.
- You’ll partner with engineering leaders to identify and execute against high leverage technical investment that ensure the long-term flexibility and sustainability of our core systems.
Skills You'll Need To Bring
- Proven track record of execution: You have 2+ years of engineering experience, including several years building world-class product experiences alongside a team of engineers.
- Shipping quality user interfaces: You partner closely with product and design to craft beautiful user experiences for large audiences, leveraging web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.
- Building the team: You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth, but also the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
- Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
- Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
- Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
Nice To Haves
- You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
- You have built or contributed to an internal platform or framework in the past.
- You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
- You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
- You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3802291162,Software Engineer,CollegeVine,https://www.linkedin.com/company/collegevine,"Boston, MA",fulltime,2024-01-10,"Who we are
Canopy AI (parent company of CollegeVine) is the world's fastest-growing guidance company. Our mission is to bring lifelong guidance to the next generation. Ivy, our AI-powered mentor and superconnector, presents students with timely advice, acts as a sounding board, and surfaces valuable real-world networking opportunities that can change life outcomes. Trusted by millions and counting for guidance on their professional journeys, we are growing quickly in both adoption and revenue. If you want to apply your skills to a unique and consequential mission, we invite you to write the next chapter of your career alongside talented and exceptional teammates at Canopy AI!
About the role:
As Canopy AI scales, we're looking to add talented engineers focused on solving real-world problems to help us build new products and scale our existing systems. Canopy AI's engineering team expects each engineer to own their work from idea into production, with focus on learning as quickly as possible. This means small batches, CI/CD, deploying to production multiple times per-day, and rapid iteration as our ideas become reality for our customers.
You'll work on a product squad alongside designers, domain experts, and other engineers to solve the correct problems and deliver our guidance technology in a safe and reliable way.
This role is fully remote.
Responsibilities:
- Own and rapidly deliver features across the full stack in partnership with your lead engineer
- Own problems end-to-end, and are willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done
- Partner directly with functions across the business to understand their needs
- Improve engineering productivity for yourself and other engineers by creating tooling, documentation, and (of course) automated tests
- Focus on solving the problems at hand, not just writing code (although that's typically how Canopy AI delivers solutions)
Requirements:
- 3+ years of software engineering experience (including internships)
- Proficiency with relational databases, modern IasS platforms, (Javascript || Ruby), and MVC web frameworks like Ruby on Rails. We also make heavy use of Purescript, so experience or an interest in learning typed-functional programming is necessary.
- You see yourself first and foremost as a pragmatic problem solver who just happens to write code
- Have a humble attitude, a love for learning, an eagerness to help your colleagues, and a desire to do whatever it takes to make the team succeed
- Care deeply about the end user experience and take pride in building products to solve customer needs
Canopy AI was originally founded in 2013 in Cambridge, MA as Admissions Hero (later CollegeVine) and reaches over 20 million families annually in search of guidance. Our roots are in delivering near-peer mentorship at scale, which has since evolved to delivering lifelong guidance through AI and a vast professional network. We have raised over $66m in venture funding from dedicated investors such as Morningside Technology Ventures (Xiaomi, TikTok), the founding partner of 5Y Capital, Fidelity, University Ventures, and more. In 2020, after years of being a remote-friendly company, Canopy became a fully remote company centered on Eastern Time with a diverse cast of team members based predominantly in the United States, but also around the world.",,,,,, Feb_05_2024-03:35-PM

You will be responsible for core product contributions, rapid-prototyping, and production-level concerns including infrastructure and security.
As a backend engineer of a fast-growing fintech startup you are going to move the needle, but it will require a split personality: Your Dr. Jekyll leans towards correctness, tight testing, and advancing the mental constructs of the organization with a series of logical hypotheses and tests; your Hyde-side is one that focuses on brutal prioritization in a sea of possibilities, good-enough testing for a code base that must be deliberately but also organically grown, and the understanding that systems must serve people, not the other way around.
Our mission is to create fair, effective, and simple financial pathways to help 100M Americans reach their financial goals. Investors include Lightspeed, Coatue and GGV. Founders are serial entrepreneurs who co-founded and served as C-suite executives at 3 FinTech unicorns.
Requirements
-  B.A. / B.S. / M.S. or strong self-taught fundamentals in computer science
-  Preferred, but not required, experience in Rails
-  4+ years of industry experience, with demonstrated breadth and depth of product impact
-  Ability to analyze data and distill information for business purposes
-  Effectiveness as demonstrated by problem-solving skills in areas outside your expertise
-  Desire to form strong professional bonds with startup-forward coworkers
What We’re Like
-  Scrappy. We had a product goal and put out the MVP, collecting our first users with steady growth via paid channels in four months. We don’t cut corners when we know we’ll need them but we don’t build things without that need. We don’t like inefficiency but we dislike operationalizing one-off tasks even more.
-  Risk-oriented. Everything has risk, but a mature team knows how to make these tradeoffs. That’s why we built the MVP fast––because time is your most valuable asset and is practically fungible with money in the startup world.
-  Data-obsessed. We all look at data and pull it, and we believe that understanding the mechanics can yield valuable insights. Complex systems require elegant, not just simple solutions. You absolutely need to be interested in data if you want to leverage your knowledge of systems.
-  Lucky. That’s how we look at this journey so far. From our timing of fundraising, to the circumstances in which we came together, to the initial product traction we’re getting, there’s no other word to describe it. We are grateful you are reading this, and we know that if you’re meant to be with us on this journey, then we will see you soon.

https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3806484176,Software Engineer,Pearl Health,https://www.linkedin.com/company/pearl-health,"New York, NY",fulltime,2024-01-19,"Who We Are...
Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in the United States. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford, Dartmouth, Harvard, Mass. General), technologists (athenahealth, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Flatiron, WalMart Health), healthcare innovators (Oscar, Aledade, VillageMD, Stellar, Arcadia) and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna, Humana, Cigna, United, Bridgewater) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to the United States’ future health. Pearl recently announced a strategic partnership to proliferate value-based care with Walgreens, one of the largest healthcare companies in the country. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, AlleyCorp, and SV Angel.
Pearl Health helps PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Medicare. Over time, this solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to the country. We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare by giving physicians the ability to better allocate their time with patients, increasing their autonomy, creating incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence, and making risk more available and more readily optimized through an intelligent marketplace.
What We Hope You Can Do...
We are seeking a passionate engineer with a track record of methodically and creatively adding value to both the business and their organization in a strategic and caring way. Your work will be a core asset of our company, allowing us to more efficiently provide better care to our members and to create novel financial arrangements for each of our aligned physicians.
Apart from being a strategic and analytical thinker, you should also be an effective communicator, an expert in the domains and systems that you have built, comfortable working with other experts on complicated risk analyses and operational flows, and be willing to directly dig in yourself as we expand our internal resources.
We are looking for strong engineers in many areas: data and data infrastructure, full-stack web application development, front-end wizards, as well as machine learning and natural language processing specialists. You should be a deeply curious individual, and have demonstrated continuous effort to satisfy that curiosity, through research, tinkering, organizing, and teaching.
What a Software Engineer Means To Us...
- Internalize the company’s goals and vision, understanding critical and minimal needs, foreseeing potential needs, and coming up with solutions that fit the context.
- Help us change the future of work for doctors in the United States by applying state of the art technology solutions, including data API development, modern integration patterns, frameworks for building beautiful, responsive applications, machine learning, natural language processing, and explicable AI - in partnership with key partners.
- Support all business lines, including sales and business development, by enabling those teams while balancing competing goals, and making difficult trade-offs when required.
- Partner effectively with Product, User Experience, Growth, and Operations toward building best-in-class systems to give our physician partners insight into their patient panels.
- Support the technology needs of various departments by creating a data-literate ecosystem, and helping the wider organization understand how the technology helps them and how to think about their initiatives in terms of our capabilities.
- Be a leader, taking initiative and ownership as needed, and connecting across the organization to come up with the best solutions that combine people, process, and software.
Who You Are…
- Working with team members with a diverse background is important to you, and you value and thrive being exposed to different perspectives. 
- 4+ years of experience in performing results-driven development in a collaborative environment.
- Preferably, have a degree in computer science, engineering, applied math or a related field; or have demonstrated significant growth and impact as an engineer, regardless of your education.
- Experienced in investing time before building to ensure you come up with a pragmatic design that has buy-in, and where you are able to best use your teammates’ strengths and feedback.
- Thoughtful collaborator, with a deep appreciation for systems design, and a passion for building amazing and powerful experiences while knowing the tradeoffs of moving quickly and getting things working vs. going deep and perfecting a product for the long-term.
- Have experience in highly regulated environments, and be mindful about privacy and security of our customers’ data.
- Healthcare or insurance or fintech experience is preferred, but tell us why you are passionate about our mission.
- For data engineers - experience in Python, relational databases and data warehouses, business intelligence tools, containers, cloud platforms, command line scripting is desirable.
- For web back-end engineers - experience in Python, relational databases, cloud platforms is desirable.
- For web front-end engineers - experience in React Javascript/Typescript, CSS, cloud platforms is desirable.
- A plus - not afraid to dive into devops as needed and help us iterate on an efficient build/deploy process and a solid infrastructure.
- Experience with startups is not necessary, but you should be looking forward to bringing order, power, and role definition to an initial blank slate.
At Pearl Health, you will have the opportunity to shape the future of healthcare technology while working in a collaborative and dynamic environment. We offer competitive compensation, comprehensive benefits, and a chance to make a meaningful impact on the lives of doctors and patients alike.

WW Clinic/Sequence's mission is to make healthcare more accessible, more transparent, and friendlier. We're addressing America's most pressing chronic conditions, starting with obesity, which affects over 50% of adults.
We Do This By
- Connecting patients with board-certified obesity specialists to provide the highest quality of care, as well as access to the most effective weight management medications available
- Assembling a team of health coaches to support our members in their journeys toward better health
- Building a community for our members to share their experiences and learn from each other about healthy lifestyle practices
And of course, to tie these pieces together, we're writing software that creates a seamless experience for our members and healthcare partners alike.
We believe that healthcare shouldn't feel like work — it should feel fun, friendly, and personal.
Why now?
When it comes to startups, being at the right place at the right time can dramatically shift the odds in your favor. So why now for WW Clinic/Sequence?
- The FDA recently approved an exceptionally effective compound, semaglutide, for use as a weight loss aid.
- Telehealth is going through unprecedented growth. McKinsey reports that ""[t]elehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.""
These tailwinds grant us the opportunity to build something incredibly valuable, while also leaving a lasting positive impact on the lives of our customers.
The Day-to-day
- We're a full-stack Typescript shop, from our frontend (React) to our backend (Node) to our cloud infrastructure (CDK). This isomorphism makes it a breeze for our engineers to work everywhere across the stack on what they're most excited about and what will have the biggest impact.
- We do daily standups in which we go over our issues in Linear, hold demo lunches where we share what we've been working on, and spend a lot of time in Slack huddles.
- You’ll contribute to core parts of our application stack, ranging from our customer-facing web application to our internal systems for automating insurance processes.
- We enjoy working together and make frequent use of our office gong to celebrate milestones.
Who You Are
We care less about your resume, and more about your motivation and excitement to grow. We’re a lean team with very high expectations. You’ll have a great time if you’re an all-star performer who enjoys wearing many hats, pushing yourself to do a little better everyday, and having a lot of fun along the way.
You'll be working in both the frontend and backend, interacting with databases, shipping maintainable code quickly, clearly communicating technical ideas to the team, and owning big pieces of our system.
With that said, here are a few things that we hope will describe you:
- You have extensive experience building and shipping full-stack Typescript applications.
- You’re a strong communicator and can elegantly describe complex technical concepts with clear and precise language.
- You want work in an ultra-fast-paced early-stage startup environment.

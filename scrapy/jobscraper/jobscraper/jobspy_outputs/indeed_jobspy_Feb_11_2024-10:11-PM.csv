https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=6d6ad1603128adb7,Platform Engineer,Abridge,,"Remote, USA",fulltime,2024-02-11,True,"Health care is all about conversations, with over 2B spoken conversations each year between patients and their care teams in just the United States. However, people forget up to 80% of those conversations, leading to worse patient outcomes. And doctors are burning out writing notes in their EMRs instead of focusing on their patients. That’s where Abridge comes in — our audio-based standalone and integrated solutions record and summarize medical conversations, anywhere care happens.
 The Role
 We’re looking for a platform engineer to help us build, secure, and scale our industry-leading natural language understanding products. You’ll work alongside our application and machine learning engineers to plan and deploy services using terraform and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You’ll also help us set up and secure integrations with our customers and partners. We are a small, collaborative team and you’ll have a big impact on how we work.
 What You'll Do
-  Partner with application engineers to build and deploy reliable, performant, and secure infrastructure for our mobile + web-based applications
-  Collaborate with engineers + customers to create secure integrations between Abridge and healthcare systems
-  Enable application teams to practice “you build it, you run it” by providing tools + process for monitoring performance, availability, and reliability
-  Identify opportunities to improve engineering velocity, and lead efforts to make those improvements through tooling and process
-  Manage CI/CD pipelines and the other major parts of our cloud-based development infrastructure
-  Advocate for and implement security best-practices at Abridge
-  Create and maintain clear, relevant, and accurate documentation
 What You'll Bring
-  5+ years of software engineering experience, including 3+ years of infrastructure-as-code experience in a cloud-first organization
-  Familiar with the care+feeding of Kubernetes clusters, including creating and maintaining helm charts for application deployments
-  Experienced in creating and maintaining CI/CD pipelines for both Infrastructure as code deployments as well as application code deployments. (Terragrunt, Atlas, ArgoCD, Octopus Deploy, Travis CI, etc.)
-  Comfortable implementing and securing services in Google Cloud Platform as Infrastructure as code, including GCP Projects, VPC Networks, Google Kubernetes Engine, and IAM Roles, Groups and policies
-  Experienced with backend scripting languages (e.g. Python, GoLang, Javascript, Rust, Bash.)
-  Up-to-date on industry best-practices and tools, and enjoy learning new things
-  Excited about being hands-on in a fast-moving, productive, and supportive environment
-  Willing to pitch in wherever needed - as a fast-moving startup we need to do good work, quickly
 We value people who want to learn new things, and we know that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.
 Why Work at Abridge?
-  Be a part of a trailblazing, mission driven organization that uses audio as the wedge to improve the healthcare delivery experience
-  Unlimited PTO, plus 12 national holidays
-  Comprehensive and generous benefits package:
-  16 weeks paid parental leave, for all employees
-  Flexible working hours — we care more about what you accomplish than what specific hours you’re working
-  Remote work environment
-  Equity for all new employees
-  Generous equipment budget for your home office setup ($1600)
-  Opportunity to work and grow with talented individuals, and have ownership and impact at a high growth startup.
-  Plus much more!
 Life at Abridge
 At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.
 Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.
 Diversity & Inclusion
 Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).
